==========

explorations in human eye tracing, as opposed to computer vision based tracings. all images CC BY-SA.

# Artist Statement

i am not an artist. i am just curious about how my personal system casts vision to the drawing board. motion-hand-coordination.

back in 2006, the summer after i dropped out of physics grad school, i started sketching, as expression and quasi-obsession, but eventually to convey my perspective.
